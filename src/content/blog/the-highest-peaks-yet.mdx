Dear friends,

Every time I feel like Purdue Hackers hits a peak, it keeps getting better. The past two months have been some of our best: Hack Night is the most magical & community-driven it‚Äôs ever been, a year-and-a-half long community hardware project was shipped, and we‚Äôre all-hands-on-deck organizing a gallery exhibition of our best projects.

_This is the_ [_Purdue Hackers_](https://purduehackers.com) _VIP Newsletter._ [_Read the previous edition here._](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/vip-newsletter-2) _If you‚Äôd rather not receive these,_ [_unsubscribe here_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSff6JvHc7istmPqk63lkCHtqOlkoQR8bxjn-rj_aKsEXlvMRg/viewform)_._

# ‚ú∑ BURST

![BURST poster](/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet/burst-poster.jpg)

Purdue Hackers is running a pop-up gallery exhibition on December 8th from 2-6pm. It‚Äôs called **BURST ‚ú∑**, and it‚Äôs a showcase of all the best projects students have made over the past two years.

BURST ‚ú∑ is the first iteration of the Show, a demo day at the end of every semester for students to share the things they‚Äôve made at Hack Night. The Show takes a completely different form every semester, including a different name and brand.

In our 11-year history, the projects of Purdue Hackers have never been seen outside Hack Night‚Äîuntil BURST ‚ú∑. We‚Äôre inviting 300+ students, faculty, and sponsors. If you can make it, you are invited too!

# ‚òéÔ∏è Hack Night

Hack Night has had its best Fall season yet, with a steady weekly attendance of 70-80.

In the last newsletter, we introduced **üèÅCheckpoints**, Hack Night‚Äôs ‚Äúmidnight demos‚Äù, where folks share things they‚Äôve made in the last week. Over 100 projects have been shared at Checkpoints so far, including a [Nintendo DS emulator](https://github.com/burhanr13/ntremu) and [Apple Intelligence on an iPhone 12](https://github.com/leminlimez/Nugget).

![Passport ceremony](/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet/passport-ceremony.jpg)

[Republic of Hackerland passports](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please) continue to be handmade at passport ceremonies during Hack Night every two weeks. Since the start of the semester, hackers have made over 40 passports, including [our 100th passport](https://passports.purduehackers.com/passport/582355527598604290)!

We turned the Hack Night 5.3 badge into a scavenger hunt, including a 7-piece hexagonal puzzle, a cipher made of vines & berries, a rotary phone, and cookies.

I remember when it felt like running Hack Night required organizers to bring all the energy. Now, our culture is strong enough that community members bring more magic than ever:

*   One group has been cooking & baking: bread, chocolate pies, fudge buckeyes, and steak. They‚Äôve been doing this nearly every week since Hack Night 5.4, entirely spontaneously.
*   Another group conducted impromptu video interviews of Hack Night attendees: what they‚Äôre making, how long they‚Äôve been coming, what they want to see improved‚Äîunprompted by organizers. They‚Äôve recorded 2 interviews so far and aim to record more as part of a larger documentation project.
*   One person recorded an 8-hour video of Hack Night from his perspective on a Meta Quest.

Thank you to ‚ù§Ô∏èAutodesk for sponsoring Hack Night 5.9, including [our first-ever steel badge](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-59); and üñ§Vercel for sponsoring _four_ of our Hack Nights, during which we shared v0, Integrations, AI SDK, & Next.js 15. Thank you also to investor & Purdue alum [Bruce Schechter](http://www.schechter.com/) for stopping by Hack Night 5.7!

# üåà A Sign from the Heavens

</div>

After a year and a half of development, organizer Jack Hogan shipped the Purdue Hackers Sign: a meter-tall Conway glider, powered by a custom PCB, whose blocks light up according to our [color-based time system](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time).

The Sign sits in the window of Hack Night every week, facing outward & letting the world know that Hack Night is happening. It‚Äôs the physical embodiment of our spirit.

This was the first community project Purdue Hackers ever funded, back in April 2023, and it‚Äôs so cool to finally see it real. Jack & everyone else who contributed learned a ton.

Jack wrote a blog post about his journey making it. Read: [A Sign from the Heavens](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign)
