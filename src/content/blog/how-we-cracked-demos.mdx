On November 4th, 2022, at [Hack Night 1.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-10), we ran the first instance of demos at Hack Night. But by [the following week](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-11), we had already stopped running them.

On February 16th, 2024, [Hack Night 4.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-40) made a second attempt at Hack Night demos, branding them ‚Äúmidnight demos‚Äù. These ran sporadically throughout Spring 2024, but had fizzled out by the end of the semester.

On August 30th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-50) introduced ‚Äúmidnight demos, but for real this time‚Äù. This kicked off the first long-lasting weekly demo session at Hack Night.

On September 13th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.2](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-52) ran the first instance of **üèÅ&nbsp;Checkpoints**, the rebranded version of midnight demos.

Checkpoints have been a resounding success. Right after everyone gathers in the main area for [the countdown to 0\~0\~0](https://youtu.be/i6dzI7AhH40?si=Cb3uobpelj93n7dr), the lights go out, the floor speaker is turned to its maximum volume, and folks line up to share what they‚Äôve built on a giant screen for all of Hack Night to see.

Today, 15-20 people share an update at Checkpoints every week, and over 100 updates have been shared. When I asked community member Ishan what he thought about the first one, he said:

> You know the feeling you get when you lost something you had, like you didn‚Äôt realize what you had until you lost it? Checkpoints are like that but the opposite: we‚Äôve gained what was missing from Hack Night.

One might expect demos at a hackathon-flavored event like Hack Night to fit in naturally, given that they‚Äôre core pieces of traditional hackathons. But it took us 2 years and 3 and a half tries to make them a part of Hack Night. Why was it such a heavy lift? The answer is a fascinating story about the history of Hack Night that I think others can learn a lot from.

# Attempt 1

The first Hack Night, [Hack Night 0.1](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-01), ran on September 16th, 2022, in a classroom in Purdue‚Äôs Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC). Hack Night‚Äôs goal was to bring people together on Friday night every week for uninterrupted time to work on personal projects. Hack Night 0.1 was a proof-of-concept: we brought people into a classroom at 7pm, played some music, stuck around until the last person left around 10:30pm, and that was it.

At the time, Purdue Hackers looked quite different from today: our efforts were concentrated on [hour-long workshops](https://events.purduehackers.com/sound-galaxy-2022) which ran roughly every two weeks. Hack Night was a bet on a new & unproven idea. It initially received some pushback, particularly around the meeting time‚ÄîFriday night is typically when people go out with friends, not go to club meetings to code, so why would we limit its potential out the gate?

Hack Night made two bets:

1. Many interesting people actually rarely go out on Friday night and are looking for a social event where they can hang out with other interesting people. Hack Night can become the Friday night social event for them.
2. Many people want to build personal projects, but academic & social obligations prevent them from finding the time or energy to follow through. Hack Night can become built-in time every week for making things.

These bets, combined with the initially uncertain nature of Hack Night, created a strong ‚Äúzero obligation‚Äù culture. Coming to Hack Night, and participating in its events, should never feel required.

[Hack Night 0.3](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03) was the initial success case of this model: a group of 20 people came with few expectations and naturally split into groups. One group of 6 got to talking about alternative ways to measure time, and by midnight, had created [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), which remains a core part of our culture today.

Even so, we felt like the completely unstructured nature of Hack Night was limiting. It was great if you already had an idea, or happened to meet someone you connected with, but it felt intimidating and isolating for everyone else.

[Hack Night 1.0](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/hack-night-1point0), on November 4th, 2022, attempted to fix this by introducing a strict, hackathon-like schedule‚Äîincluding two workshops (‚ÄúSessions‚Äù), a ‚Äú30-minute challenge‚Äù, a game break‚Äîand demos. Participation was not required for any of these events, but I laser cut a couple collectible [‚Äúbadges‚Äù](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge), engraved with the date of the event, to give out to those who chose to demo.

I had fun at Hack Night 1.0, but it was clear that the stricter hackathon-like schedule didn‚Äôt feel right. Two mini-workshops in one night was more than people wanted and required an unsustainable amount of work; and the 30-minute challenge and game break felt like forced, inorganic distractions.

Of all of Hack Night 1.0‚Äôs experiments, demos stuck around most in my brain. Giving folks the opportunity to share the things they had been working on added a lot of energy to the event, compounded by the collectible badges. But it was difficult to convince people to share works in progress‚Äîmost of the projects shared that night were backlog projects rather than things people had made that night‚Äîso it was unclear what demos would look like in following weeks.

So, the lesson had been learned: strict schedules are for hackathons; Hack Night is for unstructured work time. And by Hack Night 1.1 the following week, we had abandoned the schedule entirely.

If you haven‚Äôt picked up on it: Hack Night is ‚Äúversioned‚Äù, loosely following semantic versioning (link to wikipedia). Every week, the ‚Äúminor version‚Äù‚Äîthe number to the right of the period‚Äîincreases. The ‚Äúmajor version‚Äù‚Äîthe number to the left of the period‚Äîincreases when something notable about the structure of Hack Night changes. You can think of each ‚Äúmajor version‚Äù of Hack Night as a distinct era.

Two major versions‚ÄîHack Night 2.x and 3.x‚Äîcame and went before we tried demos again, during which Hack Night changed tremendously. [Hack Night 2.0](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/hack-night-2.0) moved the venue to the second floor of [the Bechtel Center](https://purdue.edu/bidc), Purdue‚Äôs makerspace for students, which shifted the vibe massively from the classroom in WALC. [Hack Night 3.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-30)‚Äôs most notable change was that our average weekly attendance spiked from 20 to 80. In the meantime, [badges scaled up](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge) to a core part of the Hack Night experience, and many began making their closest friends at Hack Night & making it their primary weekly hangout spot. Somewhere along the way we also brought back weekly Sessions, each one facilitated by a community member and often taking many different forms, including workshops and lightning talks.

By some of the later Hack Night 3.x events, Hack Night had become nearly unrecognizable from the versions 0.x and 1.x Hack Nights of 2022. What began as a gathering of 5-15 people in a classroom ending before midnight had become an intense 80-person production in a makerspace, with collectibles prepped more than a week in advance, at least one sub-event every week, [ambitious community projects](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), and rituals (link to countdown video), ending between 5:00 and 9:00am the next morning.

Even so, the longstanding ‚Äúzero obligation‚Äù precedent set at Hack Night 0.1 made it take a while before we attempted demos again.

Even so, it took a while to attempt demos again. The longstanding ‚Äúzero obligation‚Äù precedent set at Hack Night 0.1 primarily caused this long gap. When we moved into the Bechtel Center, it became possible to run sub-events (e.g. Sessions) in a corner of the venue without disturbing the rest of the event, and it both didn‚Äôt feel right to run demos in that corner or take over the event at the front.

Finally, however, we tried again.

# Attempt 2

[Hack Night 4.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-10), on February 16th, 2024, introduced [passport(-making ceremonies)](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please), Circles (weekly book-club style gatherings for learning new things)‚Äîand midnight demos.

By this point, we had already been running a Session every week in a corner of the venue.

[picture of the couches, labeled ‚Äúhere‚Äù]

Demos would be just like the 10pm Sessions, but at midnight and for anyone to share anything they‚Äôve ever made. Participation was optional and there were no rules around what you could share. Works in progress were encouraged.

The first instance was of midnight demos a lot of fun. The first project shared that night, and one of my favorites, was a packet sniffer written in C. Once a couple people had shared, the ball began rolling, and 90 minutes later we still had people sharing projects both technical and nontechnical. I was especially excited by the nontechnical projects: to me, this was a sign that we had overcome the barrier of intimidation that typically plagues demo sessions like this, especially since intertwined were highly impressive technical projects.

But none of the demo sessions after Hack Night 4.0 were quite as magical, and in fact they only ran a few times at all.
