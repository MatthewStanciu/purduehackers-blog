On November 4th, 2022, at [Hack Night 1.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-10), we ran the first instance of demos at Hack Night. But by [the following week](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-11), we had already stopped running them.

On February 16th, 2024, [Hack Night 4.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-40) made a second attempt at Hack Night demos, branding them ‚Äúmidnight demos‚Äù. These ran sporadically throughout Spring 2024, but had fizzled out by the end of the semester.

On August 30th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-50) introduced ‚Äúmidnight demos, but for real this time‚Äù. This kicked off the first long-lasting weekly demo session at Hack Night.

On September 13th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.2](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-52) ran the first instance of **üèÅ&nbsp;Checkpoints**, the rebranded version of midnight demos.

Checkpoints have been a resounding success. Right after everyone gathers in the main area for [the countdown to 0\~0\~0](https://youtu.be/i6dzI7AhH40?si=Cb3uobpelj93n7dr), the lights go out, the floor speaker is turned to its maximum volume, and folks line up to share what they‚Äôve built on a giant screen for all of Hack Night to see.

Today, 15-20 people share an update at Checkpoints every week, and over 100 updates have been shared. When I asked community member Ishan what he thought about the first one, he said:

> You know the feeling you get when you lost something you had, like you didn‚Äôt realize what you had until you lost it? Checkpoints are like that but the opposite: we‚Äôve gained what was missing from Hack Night.

One might expect demos at a hackathon-flavored event like Hack Night to fit in naturally, given that they‚Äôre core pieces of traditional hackathons. But it took us 2 years and 3 and a half tries to make them a part of Hack Night. Why was it such a heavy lift? The answer is a fascinating story about the history of Hack Night that I think others can learn a lot from.

# Attempt 1

The first Hack Night, [Hack Night 0.1](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-01), ran on September 16th, 2022, in a classroom in Purdue‚Äôs Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC). Hack Night‚Äôs goal was to bring people together on Friday night every week for uninterrupted time to work on personal projects. Hack Night 0.1 was a proof-of-concept: we brought people into a classroom at 7pm, played some music, stuck around until the last person left around 10:30pm, and that was it.

At the time, Purdue Hackers looked quite different from today: our efforts were concentrated on [hour-long workshops](https://events.purduehackers.com/sound-galaxy-2022) which ran roughly every two weeks. Hack Night was a bet on a new & unproven idea. It initially received some pushback, particularly around the meeting time‚ÄîFriday night is typically when people go out with friends, not go to club meetings to code, so why would we limit its potential out the gate?

Hack Night made two bets:

1. Many interesting people are actually rarely going out on Friday night, and are looking for a social event where they can hang out with other interesting people. Hack Night can become the Friday night social event.
2. Many people want to build personal projects, but academic & social obligations prevent them from finding the time or energy to follow through. Hack Night can become built-in time every week for making things.

These bets, combined with the initially uncertain nature of Hack Night, created a strong ‚Äúzero obligation‚Äù culture. Coming to Hack Night should never feel required, and participating in events within Hack Night should never feel required.

[Hack Night 0.3](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-03) was the initial success case of this model: a group of 20 people came with few expectations and naturally split into groups. One group of 6 got to talking about alternative ways to measure time, and by midnight, had created [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), which remains a core part of our culture today.

Even so, we felt like the completely unstructured nature of Hack Night was limiting. It was great if you already had an idea, or happened to meet someone you connected with, but it felt intimidating and isolating for everyone else.

[Hack Night 1.0](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/hack-night-1point0), on November 4th, 2022, attempted to fix this by introducing a strict, hackathon-like schedule‚Äîincluding two workshops (‚ÄúSessions‚Äù), a ‚Äú30-minute challenge‚Äù, a game break‚Äîand demos. Participation was not required for any of these events, but I laser cut a couple [‚Äúbadges‚Äù](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge), engraved with the date of the event, to give out to those who chose to demo.

I had fun at Hack Night 1.0, but it was clear that the stricter hackathon-like schedule didn‚Äôt feel right. Two mini-workshops in one night was more than people wanted and required an unsustainable amount of work; and the 30-minute challenge and game break felt like forced, inorganic distractions. Demos were a highlight of the night, but it was difficult to convince folks to share works in progress.

Of all of Hack Night 1.0‚Äôs experiments, demos was the one that stuck around most in my brain. Seeing all the things folks had been working on presented to the group added a lot of energy to the night, compounded by the collectible badges. I liked the idea of having

Nevertheless, the lesson had been learned: strict schedules are for hackathons; Hack Night is for unstructured work time.
