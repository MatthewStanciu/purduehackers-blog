On November 4th, 2022, at [Hack Night 1.0](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/hack-night-1point0), we ran the first instance of demos at Hack Night. But by [the following week](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-11), we had already stopped running them.

On February 16th, 2024, [Hack Night 4.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-40) made a second attempt at Hack Night demos, branding them “midnight demos”. These ran sporadically throughout Spring 2024, but had fizzled out by the end of the semester.

On August 30th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.0](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-50) introduced “midnight demos, but for real this time”. This kicked off the first long-lasting weekly demo session at Hack Night.

On September 13th, 2024, [Hack Night 5.2](https://events.purduehackers.com/hack-night-52) ran the first instance of **🏁&nbsp;Checkpoints**, the rebranded version of midnight demos.

Checkpoints have been a resounding success. Right after everyone gathers in the main area for [the countdown to 0\~0\~0](https://youtu.be/i6dzI7AhH40?si=Cb3uobpelj93n7dr), the lights go out, the floor speaker is turned on to its maximum volume, and folks line up to share what they’ve built on a giant screen for all of Hack Night to see.

Today, 15-20 people share an update at Checkpoints every week, and over 100 updates have been shared. When I asked community member Ishan what he thought about the first one, he said:

> You know the feeling you get when you lost something you had, like you didn’t realize what you had until you lost it? Checkpoints are like that but the opposite: we’ve gained what was missing from Hack Night.

One might expect demos at a hackathon-flavored event like Hack Night to fit in naturally, given that they’re core pieces of traditional hackathons. But it took us 2 years and 3 and a half tries to make them a part of Hack Night. Why was it such a heavy lift? The answer is a fascinating story about the history of Hack Night that I think others can learn a lot from.
