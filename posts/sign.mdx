ogDescription: The journey to make Purdue Hackers' first large-scale hardware project.

We spent the last year and a half designing, building, and programming a meter-tall sign of our logo. While our Sign may look heavenly, the journey to get it to completion was anything but. Now, we’re sharing our journey with you.

# I: Spark

It all started near the end of April 2023 at Hack Night 2.6. A group of Hack Night attendees got together and started brainstorming cool hardware projects that we could pursue. A bunch of cool ideas came out of that session, including a flag, an update to Lightning Time, and. The big project of the night, though, was a massive sign of our logo. We envisioned a shining monument to Purdue Hackers, with massive LED panels that we could stick in the window of our venue to show the world that Hack Night was happening.

The day after, I started work on the custom PCB that would power the sign, and another attendee started working on a miniature 3D model of the sign, which would be scaled up in the end.

While I didn't initially expect to, I ended up taking a leading position on this project. I thought it would be good to have a project of my own that others at Purdue Hackers could help with, so off I went. I made up a parts list, got a budget to work with of about $200, and ordered the necessary electronic components.

# II: Rise

Once everyone got back from summer break in August 2023, work resumed on the sign almost instantly. I started work on the CAD for the project, and I did the finishing touches on the PCB I made a few months ago. After a few Hack Nights, we finally got around to ordering the parts. We agreeded upon a reasonable $200 floating budget, and I went to what I believed was the best-value online electronics store, Mouser, and put together a cart. This would come back to haunt us later, but for right now everything was going great.

It didn't take too long for me to get a basic CAD together with the knowledge I had, and at that point we said, "yeah, looks good". We gave an estimated timeline of six-ish months to complete the entire project, hardware and software, so we could start showing it off to prospective members as soon as possible. In fact, since this was our first hardware initiative, we expected to fund many more similar projects like this so other Hackers could get into the physical space just like me. Unfortunately, none of us were very experienced with hardware design at the time, so we had no idea how wrong we were.

[CAD OF THE SIGN]

There was some debate over what the sign should be made out of. Some suggested wood, others sheet metal. We decided that 3D printing would be the easiest way to get the necessary contours without having to deal with advanced manufacturing techniques that could drive us over time or budget. This resulted in us getting four reels of filament, totaling $84.96. This wasn’t even the most expensive part of the (initial) purchase order of the sign: the LED light strips cost $99. We knew that a $200 was an optimistic target, but with just these two purchases we had blown that budget. We decided to expand the budget to $400 at this point.

Soon after, the PCBs came in. They looked amazing! We were super excited to get everything soldered to it once the rest of the parts came in. I started working on the firmware for the sign around this point, and while it was a challenge working without many of the creature comforts I was used to within the context of an operating system, I made an initial prototype. At this point we thought we would have a fully-working sign in September, at the latest October.

# III: Fall

Soon enough, the parts that I'd ordered arrived and we got our first look at the electronics. Everything looked great at first glance! Everything we needed was there, and I was even able to source some extra parts from my supply so we could save some cash. We were over budget by about $70, but it was fine, right? This was the big expense out of the way. This semester, Hazel, a computer engineer, had started coming to Hack Night, and she had taken some interest in the sign project. We decided to do the PCB assembly together as a fun project, and her experience in the field would be very helpful regardless.

The second we set up our soldering station for the PCB, we immediately realized two problems, one obvious but fixable, the other more discrete but possibly deadly. First, none of the holes were sized correctly, and some of them were in a completely incorrect location. This was disheartening, but we could work around it by bending leads, making what we called "ballerina transistors" to get around this issue. The second problem took Hazel some time to notice, but when she did, it signed this initial board's death warrant: the traces, or copper paths on the PCB that relays signals between components, were woefully thin for the power we were gonna push through them. We had plans to push around 60 watts of power on traces designed to take about 5 to 10 watts. Oops. This was such an under-spec that it was very possible that the board could catch on fire. Needless to say, we had to rethink some things.

One night I was out at dinner with some friends, one of whom was Caleb, a mechanical engineer. I was talking about the Sign, and Caleb asked to see the CAD out of curiosity. I pulled it up, and he immediately said, "where's your timeline, your joints, your constraints?" I responded, "what do you mean?" He gave me a look that I knew meant one thing: I had made more than a few mistakes. Luckily I hadn't sent off the CAD to be cut and printed yet, so it was really good that he had caught these issues early. Soon after this, I made a real effort to figure out a bill of materials for the structure of the sign. Unfortunately, I had completely underestimated the costs, and we were gonna end up with a sign that would cost around $700 in total, 3.5 times our original budget.

Even after these fixes, I failed to account for the tolerance of the 3D printing, and therefore all of the holes for the connections between the blocks were too small, forcing me to sand the holes for hours to get the pipes to barely fit.

At this point I needed a break, which I would get since there was a lot of fixing to be done.

# IV: Rebirth

After a few months of work, thing were starting to look up. We had the pipes connecting the blocks together, and the new PCB was delivered. We attached the new and improved components and the sign came to life!

As an aside, by this point, two people who had helped print the sign blocks, Tommy and Tejas, had even made a miniature version of the Sign to show how “easy” it was to get a working product. It was cute, working, but also one tenth the height of the actual thing.
