ogDescription: The journey to make Purdue Hackers' first large-scale hardware project.

We spent the last year and a half designing, building, and programming a meter-tall sign of our logo. While our Sign may look heavenly, the journey to get it to completion was anything but. Now, we’re sharing our journey with you.

# I: Spark

It all started near the end of April 2023 at Hack Night 2.6. A group of Hack Night attendees got together and started brainstorming cool hardware projects that we could pursue. A bunch of cool ideas came out of that session, including a flag, an update to Lightning Time, and. The big project of the night, though, was a massive sign of our logo. We envisioned a shining monument to Purdue Hackers, with massive LED panels that we could stick in the window of our venue to show the world that Hack Night was happening.

The day after, I started work on the custom PCB that would power the sign, and another attendee started working on a miniature 3D model of the sign, which would be scaled up in the end.

While I didn't initially expect to, I ended up taking a leading position on this project. I thought it would be good to have a project of my own that others at Purdue Hackers could help with, so off I went. I made up a parts list, got a budget to work with, and ordered the necessary electronic components.

April 2023: Hack Night 2.6/7

- Brainstorming
- The initial plan
- The road ahead
- What everyone was thinking at the time
  - Lean into that in II
- Taking up the mantle, not a solo project, would still need lots of help
- Picture of 3D printed sign, whiteboard if we have it

# II: Rise

Once everyone got back from summer break in August 2023, work resumed on the sign almost instantly. I started work on the CAD for the project, and I did the finishing touches on the PCB I made a few months ago.

April - November 2023

- The initial PCB and CAD
- Ordering parts
- Initial assembly and budgeting
- “Everything seems to be going well so far”
- Pictures of CAD and original PCB

# III: Fall

December 2023 - February 2024

- Bad tolerances
- Fire hazard-level PCB design
- Way over-budget
- Hazel, Caleb arrive

# IV: Rebirth

March 2024 - ????

- Hazel, Caleb fixes stuff
- The Mini Sign
- Not without trouble: Pico issues
- INSERT WHAT HAPPENS WITH NEW PICO HERE, I HOPE ITS GOOD
