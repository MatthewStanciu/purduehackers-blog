ogDescription: The journey to make Purdue Hackers' first large-scale hardware project.

We spent the last year and a half designing, building, and programming a meter-tall sign of our logo. While our Sign may look heavenly, the journey to get it to completion was anything but. Now, we’re sharing our journey with you.

# I: Spark

April 2023: Hack Night 2.7

- Brainstorming
- The initial plan
- The road ahead
- What everyone was thinking at the time
  - Lean into that in II
- Taking up the mantle, not a solo project, would still need lots of help

# II: Rise

April - November 2023

- The initial PCB and CAD
- Ordering parts
- Initial assembly and budgeting
- “Everything seems to be going well so far”

# III: Fall

December 2023 - February 2024

- Bad tolerances
- Fire hazard-level PCB design
- Way over-budget
- Hazel, Caleb arrive

# IV: Rebirth

March 2024 - ????

- Hazel, Caleb fixes stuff
- The Mini Sign
- Not without trouble: Pico issues
- INSERT WHAT HAPPENS WITH NEW PICO HERE, I HOPE ITS GOOD

# V: Future

- Future plans
- Lessons learned
- “Overall, not too bad”
- Positive end note
