My biggest criticism of all past Purdue Hackers leadership since its founding in 2013 is that they invested very little in documentation. I have almost no idea what Purdue Hackers looked like before I joined in 2021, and the only way to find out now is to track down past presidents and hear the little they remember from being there years ago. Much of the org's history has been lost to time.

I've made a highly conscious effort to invest in documentation while I'm here. This began with our [Events site](https://events.purduehackers.com) last year, and this blog is part of the effort.

In the spirit of documentation, transparency, and open-source collaboration, I want to share a detailed account of what Purdue Hackers looks like today, including what we're doing well, what we need to do better, and what I'm excited for next year. My hope is that this can be the start of a yearly tradition that continues after I'm gone.

# What Purdue Hackers looks like

Purdue Hackers is made up of three core programs: community, workshops, and Hack Night.

## Community

Our community is on Discord and currently has 1,339 members. It's the 9th-largest server on Discord's Purdue Student Hub and the 3rd-largest in "Clubs", behind b01lers (1,389) and Purdue University Gamers Group (2,001). We have about 15 distinct weekly active members with an average of 1,000 messages sent every week.

## Workshops

Workshops are events where people learn something new and make a project together, led by a facilitator. A typical workshop lasts one hour.
