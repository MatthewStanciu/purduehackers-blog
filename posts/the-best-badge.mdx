ogDescription: The story of a vine cipher, modded rotary phone, and a scavenger hunt.

More than half of our Hack Night badges are “the best badge we’ve ever made”. We say this about so many of our badges that the phrase has become a meme among Hack Night regulars, and an expectation of future badges: given four badges, you can expect two or three of them to be “the best badge we’ve ever made”.

But this week, we outdid ourselves so hard that it deserves its own entry in Purdue Hackers lore. The Hack Night 5.3 badge is the best badge we’ve ever made, by quite a long shot, and it’s emblematic of what makes Purdue Hackers so special today.

# What are badges?

Every week, we hand out free laser-cut collectibles to attendees of Hack Night, our Friday night hacker festival. Each “badge” is engraved with the Hack Night version & date, and can only be earned by coming to its associated Hack Night.

Every badge is a labor of love. We begin a week and a half before its associated Hack Night by brainstorming a theme—e.g. “desert”, “slime”, “flat earth”. From there, we source & order material—usually acrylic sheets of a color that matches the theme. We then spend days creating an intricate vector design, often doing more than one iteration. Finally, we laser cut 80-100 ~2-inch badges out of our material at the [Bechtel Center](https://www.purdue.edu/bidc/), Purdue’s free makerspace for students, in a process that takes 2-3 hours.

We’ve done all this every week, never missing a week, since Hack Night 1.0 in November 2022. And they keep getting better: since we started making badges two years ago, we’ve learned what works, gotten more creative with our themes, and taken more community contributions, both theme suggestions and designs. Longtime Hack Night regulars have large collection of badges, and many of our alumni have brought their collections to their new homes.

# The Hack Night 5.3 badge

A typical badge is one design from which we make 80 copies. But we’ve strayed from this norm before: the badges for Hack Nights 3.2, 3.11, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 all had more than one version.

Last week, we decided to take this idea even further: a badge that has 7 versions which, when put together, reveal a message to be decoded, kicking off a scavenger hunt.

## Creating the badge

Immediately, some people proposed variations of hexagonal tiling:

Then we brainstormed what a puzzle in this format would look like. The first piece was numbers: what if each badge contained a few seemingly meaningless numbers that gained meaning when you put them together?

We settled on ASCII codes that spelled out a message when all badges were put together. But that didn’t feel like enough: hiding a message in ASCII codes is an old trick that we expected many players to figure out. We wanted the message to fill the whole badge, be beautiful enough for each badge to stand on its own without the scavenger hunt, and feel alien.

With that, our brains moved toward the “vine script”: the Spoken Language Circle, which meets at every Hack Night at 9pm, has been developing a writing system based on vines with leaves and berries—and they had recently made great progress. It’s still far away from being “production-ready”—the spoken language  itself is very early, so the vine script today is effectively a cipher for English sounds—but that could actually make it a great fit for this badge, since it would make it possible to decode without having to also translate an alien language.

By this point, we had settled on 7 versions of a badge, each hexagonal-shaped and tiled into a honeycomb. Once tiled into a honeycomb, players would notice two things: a long vine, with berries and leaves, running across every badge, spelling out a message; and two to three ASCII codes on each badge, which altogether would spell out another message.

Finally, we wondered, what should the messages be? Our brains turned to the phone bell, which Hazel has been developing over the last couple months. The eventual goal is to use a rotary phone as the “doorbell” for entry to Hack Night, whose doors are locked, instead of a QR code, which is the current solution.

What if we repurposed the phone bell to be the final step in the scavenger hunt? The ASCII codes could spell out a URL [whose website](https://53-seven.vercel.app) contained the key for decoding the vine script, as well as an answer box for the final answer to the scavenger hunt. The message in the vine could tell players to find the rotary phone, which we would hide somewhere in the building, and dial a number. Once players dialed the right numbers, they would be patched into the “Evil Purdue Hackers” universe, where two people are discussing the projects Evil Hack Night attendees are building.

With this, Sean created a final design, filling in the vine and rotating some of the badges to make the puzzle a little harder.

Can you figure out the message in the vine? All the information you need to solve it is in the design itself.
