More than half of our Hack Night badges are “the best badge we’ve ever made”. We say this about so many of our badges that the phrase has become a meme among Hack Night regulars, and an expectation of future badges: given four badges, you can expect two or three of them to be “the best badge we’ve ever made”.

But this week, we outdid ourselves so hard that it deserves its own entry in Purdue Hackers lore. The Hack Night 5.3 badge is the best badge we’ve ever made, by quite a long shot, and it’s emblematic of what makes Purdue Hackers so special today.

# What are badges?

Every week, we hand out free laser-cut collectibles to attendees of Hack Night, our Friday night hacker festival. Each “badge” is engraved with the Hack Night version & date, and can only be earned by coming to its associated Hack Night.

Every badge is a labor of love. We begin a week and a half before its associated Hack Night by brainstorming a theme—e.g. “desert”, “slime”, “flat earth”. From there, we source & order material—usually acrylic sheets of a color that matches the theme. We then spend days creating an intricate vector design, often doing more than one iteration. Finally, we laser cut 80-100 ~2-inch badges out of our material at the [Bechtel Center](https://www.purdue.edu/bidc/), Purdue’s free makerspace for students, in a process that takes 2-3 hours.

We’ve done all this every week, never missing a week, since Hack Night 1.0 in November 2022. And they keep getting better: since we started making badges two years ago, we’ve learned what works, gotten more creative with our themes, and taken more community contributions, both theme suggestions and designs. Longtime Hack Night regulars have large collection of badges, and many of our alumni brought their collections to their new homes.

# The Hack Night 5.3 badge

A typical badge is one design from which we make 80 copies. But we’ve strayed from this norm before: the badges for Hack Nights 3.2, 3.11, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 all had more than one version.

Last week, we decided to take this idea even further: a badge that has 7 versions which, when put together, reveal a message to be decoded, kicking off a scavenger hunt.
